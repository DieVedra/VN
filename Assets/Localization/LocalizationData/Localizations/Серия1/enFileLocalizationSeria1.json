  "str_DCE39A2D": "Let's run! We'll get used to the water faster that way!",
  "str_10B6BBD3": "We ran toward the morning waves and started splashing each other with water, laughing and screaming.",
  "str_792B001D": "Okay, we've cooled off enough - we still need to set up the tent.",
  "str_2AE47509": "We came out of the sea.",
  "str_4E5BAF2E": "Droplets of salt water sparkled like tiny crystals on our slightly tanned bodies.",
  "str_297AFBDC": "Our bodies quickly adjusted to the sea temperature, and we continued fooling around for a couple more minutes.",

  "str_A50B9826": "Could we just spend the whole day lounging on the beach?",
  "str_6B6A2799": "We'll have time for that. We need to find the hottest party spot here. We came for adventure!",
  "str_3144B248": "Are you sure?",
  "str_8B06A37C": "Of course! Tonight we're going to a local band's concert - I've already checked it out. The concert's at 7 PM.",
  "str_D1D1D024": "Then we still have a couple hours to lounge and sunbathe.",

  "str_8ACE628C": "Miranda and I laid out our towels and started sunbathing under the summer sun.",

  "str_637B9CA5": "I noticed a yacht appearing in the coastal waters.",
  "str_20D0F6B9": "Miranda, look! There's a yacht out at sea - it's huge!",
  "str_8B13C6B5": "Well, more like medium-sized. But still interesting. Maybe there are some guys on it?",
  "str_50B091BA": "Looks like it's going to be a hot day!",
  "str_6720FCBB": "The main thing is that they're nice people - who they are doesn't matter as much!",
  "str_A593FB37": "Hmm. What difference does it make? It's not like we're going to approach them.",
  "str_C066BAD3": "Hell yeah! We're going all out!",
  "str_E58D036C": "I don't know about nice, but I think they might surprise us!",
  "str_D362C275": "Oh we're definitely approaching them!",
  "str_23C476A2": "Miranda got up from her towel and started waving at the passing yacht.",
  "str_2BB2E8E0": "What are you doing? We don't know who's on there!",
  "str_5C1FE3AD": "Probably just some fun young people with money. Connections like that can't hurt!",
  "str_CF0F4EC4": "What should I do?",
  "str_C3067075": "The yacht changed course and approached the shore. Two muscular male silhouettes became visible on deck.",
  "str_CA435CE4": "Look, they noticed us!",
  "str_C5E0B7DB": "Miranda looked at the yacht with interest.",
  "str_9CBCCB38": "The yacht stopped in the coastal waters, and the guys got on jet skis and headed our way.",
  "str_2EB1BFB3": "I hope this is worth it...",
  "str_ADAD6096": "God, look how handsome they are - I call dibs on the dark-haired one!",
  "str_2DA7F895": "I looked over the young men. They really were very attractive.",
  "str_2B802345": "While Miranda stared shamelessly at the yacht, the guys had already reached the shore and parked their jet skis.",
  "str_6B622357": "Hi girls! I'm Edwin, and this is Mark!",
  "str_C1F56C58": "Mark waved at us.",
  "str_2F7FA4E7": "Hi boys! I'm Miranda!",
  "str_403F41F1": "Miranda gave me a meaningful look, clearly indicating I should introduce myself.",
  "str_43ABDD7C": "Flirtatiously wink at Edwin",
  "str_C50DD97B": "Flirtatiously wink at Mark",
  "str_DC8DD5AA": "Say: 'Hi'",
  "str_AB5DF625": "...",
  "str_4C3B53BB": "Miranda suddenly pushed me aside and said: 'It's so great we met you'.",
  "str_04F3572B": "Edwin smiled at me, slightly embarrassed.",
  "str_612FFDE3": "This is Alice - we just got here today but we're ready to party hard!",
  "str_DD679C0B": "Hi",
  "str_FAFCDDAD": "Haha, you're quick. Do you live right on the beach?",
  "str_40D520AE": "Stand up and wave with Miranda",
  "str_5B899CEB": "Ignore the yacht",
  "str_AB7413D7": "Stand up and watch the yacht with interest",
  "str_90FA936E": "+2 Passion",
  "str_C1C05402": "Yes, but if we find somewhere more interesting...",
  "str_97C17D8E": "Well, we want to be near the sea!",
  "str_D785A601": "It's not such a bad option.",
  "str_CB7CA2F6": "Anyway, if we find somewhere more interesting, we might consider changing locations.",
  "str_4A3440D6": "I think it's a great option - always being by the sea, watching sunsets and sunrises, sleeping under the stars.",
  "str_D7CC0DA6": "I mean, it might be dangerous - this is a wild beach with no lifeguards or security.",
  "str_34433068": "Well then, good thing we met you - you can keep an eye on us!",
  "str_5695D367": "I think we can arrange that!",
  "str_87ADDAA2": "The guys sat down near us and we chatted for a while.",
  "str_D4032E09": "It turned out Edwin was local and owned the nightclub we were planning to go to for the concert.",
  "str_9CB42A59": "And Mark wasn't from here - he only came for summers to relax and run one of his seasonal businesses.",
  "str_A907546C": "So are you staying here long?",
  "str_C2F6D552": "For a week.",
  "str_FB1ECE01": "We haven't decided yet.",
  "str_45D19FDE": "Why? Do you want to spend more time with us?",
  "str_EA6ACAC2": "Edwin thinks you're flirting with him.",
  "str_59E39F8E": "Maybe we should exchange numbers, Alice? Just in case. In case you need that promised protection on the wild beach?",
  "str_3EAD94B9": "Exchange numbers.",
  "str_EBDE0A29": "Don't give your number.",
  "str_6A50BAC8": "Give Edwin your number?",
  "str_B972B3CC": "Sorry, but you're moving too fast.",
  "str_037EBE2E": "Sorry, I didn't mean to rush things.",
  "str_62DA393A": "Now you can text Edwin.",
  "str_959217CC": "The guy raised an eyebrow, looking puzzled at our lonely tent on the sand.",
  "str_96F82103": "Do you live right on the beach?",
  "str_2DE47FFC": "You know who's always ready for a phone chat? That's right - me! Mark, you can take my number too by the way.",
  "str_2D01285F": "Yeah, sure. Alice, what about you?",
  "str_9A2F60C2": "Mark glanced awkwardly at Miranda but decided to support her initiative.",
  "str_714B8E9F": "Miranda gave me a reproachful look.",
  "str_1089CFEA": "Give Mark your number.",
  "str_42C34961": "Don't give your number.",
  "str_F0495746": "Give him your number?",
  "str_AF3725B3": "Now you can text Mark.",
  "str_6182709B": "The guys stayed and chatted a bit more before suggesting we continue our acquaintance.",
  "str_3ED61BC4": "Maybe we could meet tonight after your concert?",
  "str_8E58169F": "Why not? Sounds like a good idea.",
  "str_A2154505": "Great, see you tonight then!",
  "str_301AAAE5": "See you later, Mark!",
  "str_1C3B323F": "See you later, Edwin!",
  "str_19BDD45A": "See you tonight, guys!",
  "str_DFFF7EA0": "The guys leisurely got on their jet skis and headed back toward the yacht.",
  "str_A91B6678": "I think we've been lying in the sun too long. I felt my skin starting to sting with sudden movements.",
  "str_8AB9C36C": "Time to get ready for the concert.",
  "str_DCEB51DD": "Was it my imagination, or were you flirting with Mark?",
  "str_9652DBA2": "Well, it's not my fault.",
  "str_B8D60B2B": "Sorry, it was an accident.",
  "str_CF68A88F": "I don't think so",
  "str_65E0565A": "Miranda will remember this!",
  "str_8B9D88EB": "We might not forget everything.",
  "str_BD04481F": "Sorry, it was accidental. Didn't mean to upset you - I was just trying to be nice.",
  "str_C585700E": "Really? Tonight you'd better be nice to Edwin and leave Mark to me.",
  "str_73557CBC": "I hope so, because I really liked him.",
  "str_994BDD22": "It's not my fault guys are attracted to me. Besides, we're here on vacation. Soon we'll leave and forget everything that happened.",
  "str_3530C99E": "You were shamelessly staring at Mark. I told you I like him!",
  "str_762A0BD2": "You imagined it, I just said hi.",
  "str_402BC1AA": "Stop it, I'm not blind!",
  "str_C7C9C12F": "They're really sweet! How do you like Edwin?",
  "str_03EF38A8": "I don't think I need a vacation fling.",
  "str_7B057D9E": "He seemed like a nice guy.",
  "str_CA32D845": "I don't know, I liked Mark.",
  "str_7D3AB311": "Alright, let's get ready for the concert.",
  "str_FB33741F": "I'm not sure I have the right clothes.",
  "str_5068E5EA": "I thought camping meant we'd be in the woods or on the beach the whole time. I didn't plan for this kind of vacation.",
  "str_C6E5D3EE": "Then borrow something of mine.",
  "str_CD4FA4A7": "Miranda cooled down a bit...",
  "str_AF1DEAE0": "Okay, now we can go!",
  "str_3DF0AC64": "I think I hear some strange noise.",
  "str_16807308": "It's right near us. Let's check it out.",
  "str_0258ABB3": "The girls walked away from the tent and saw a male figure. The man seemed to be talking to himself and nervously fiddling with something in his hands.",
  "str_D7791C8A": "The figure suddenly turned and walked straight toward us.",
  "str_0376B58B": "Hello girls!",
  "str_D23FD5B1": "The man said threateningly as he approached us closely.",
  "str_3C5087A8": "Red Dress",
